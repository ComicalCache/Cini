    Keep a list of Documents in memory, when e.g. switching Documents (or opening new ones), just update the Document
    pointer of the active (or last active) view but keep the Document opened in memory.

    Commands should be grouped into a transaction. If the user issues a command that makes 50 primitive insert calls,
    one undo should undo all the changes. The command loop wraps every executed user command into a transaction making
    this implicit.

    The event loop should not only wait for key-presses but a number of things and otherwise sleep (libuv):
        1. IO: keypresses, pipes, sockets (like stdout of background processes)
        2. Timers: save every 5s, hide this tooltip after 2s, etc...
        3. Signals: SIGWINCH, SIGINT, etc...

    Adding/removing modes should be deferred until after the Editor::process_key function finished using pending
    std::vectors that track the changes.
