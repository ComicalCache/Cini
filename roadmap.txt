- Hooks
    Events that emit a function call (e.g. before-save).

More concepts:
    Keep a list of Documents in memory, when e.g. switching Documents (or opening new ones), just update the Document
    pointer of the active (or last active) view but keep the Document opened in memory.
    => Editor::documents_ ✅

    The Document should store a (saved) cursor position to restore when it is brought back in view in order to continue
    where left off. The actual cursor should be stored in the View to allow for proper split editing. Analogous must
    the View store the cursor position in the Document when the Document is put in the background.

    Documents are configured during setup, based on e.g. file extension. This determines the Major Mode of the Document.

    Commands should be grouped into a transaction. If the user issues a command that makes 50 primitive insert calls,
    one undo should undo all the changes. The command loop wraps every executed user command into a transaction making
    this implicit.

    The event loop should not only wait for key-presses but a number of things and otherwise sleep (libuv):
        1. IO: keypresses, pipes, sockets (like stdout of background processes)
        2. Timers: save every 5s, hide this tooltip after 2s, etc...
        3. Signals: SIGWINCH, SIGINT, etc...

    Adding/removing modes should be deferred until after the Editor::process_key function finished using pending
    std::vectors that track the changes.
